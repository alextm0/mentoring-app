## Tips for Reducing AI Dependence

- Read Documentation: For Next.js, Drizzle, or any library, the official docs typically have clear examples.

- Break Down Problems: Write out logic flows on paper or in your code comments before coding.
- Manual Debugging: Use console logs, Postman, or the browser network tab to see whatâ€™s happening.
- Ask for Help in Human Communities: If truly stuck, ask peers or communities like Reddit or Stack Overflow.
- Use AI for Brainstorming, Not Copy-Paste: Let it help you see possible approaches, but write final code on your own so you truly understand it.
